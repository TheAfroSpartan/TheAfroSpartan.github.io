    <span class="byline">Andrew's favorite shower thoughts</span>
    <p>The people that make Pringles say that 'once you pop you can't stop.' But they are the only company that make crisps that come with a lid you can put back on.</p>

    <p>Coffee makes you hyper, but coffee shops are designed for people to chill, whereas alcohol is a depressant but bars and clubs are designed for people to be energetic.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"
Everyone talks about how traveling back in time and doing something small, like killing a butterfly, can drastically change the present, but no one talks about how doing something small today, like planting a tree, can drastically change the future."</h2>
    </div>

    <p>If the dead could actually roll in their graves, there could be a new proffesion where you just say dumb stuff throughout the day to make them generate electricity.</p>

    <p>In 100 years kids will learn about the first picture of a black hole, and compare it to their crystal clear pictures.</p>
